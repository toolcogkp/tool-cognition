These are the data used for acquiring push functionality features as detailed in Section 4.1 of the manuscript. The data was obtained from a simulated model of the Olivia III robot
performing object manipulation trials, using its right arm end effector, in ROS Gazebo environment. Contact sensors covering the end effector registered contact points with the object. Data of the contact positions on the robot end effector was collected at 100Hz from the start to end of each manipulation motion. 

For the pushing task, the environment consisted of a tabletop in front of the robot, and an object on the tabletop. The robot was required to manipulate the object over a distance of 10cm in 3 different directions: north, west, and south. For northward pushing, the robot spread its fingers and pushed the object with the inside of its palm. For westward and southward sliding, the robot used the side of its palm. For each direction, the robot performed 60 trials, with random initial object position (uniformly
distributed about nominal position with 2cm maximum deviation in x and y directions). Data for cylindrical objects of 4cm and 8cm diameters are included in this repository.
